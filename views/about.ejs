              <p>Hey there! I'm Uday Ashish. Currently, I'm a student pursuing my Bachelor of Technology at the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad. I have a passion for learning and enjoy delving into new concepts. <br> <br>   

                This website is a project born out of my curiosity to explore Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's been a great learning experience for me, and I'm excited to share what I've discovered along the way. Join me on this journey of discovery and growth!</p>
